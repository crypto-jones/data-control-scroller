# Data Control Scroller
A take-home frontend coding challenge for a company I will keep anonymous for the integrity of their assignment.

## Checklist

### Core Features

- [X] Used only standard libraries (apart from loading animation which are unrelated to core features)

## Rationale
- Styled Components
  - Faster setup than SASS/LESS for projects need to be done quickly
  - Scopes styles to a component to avoid style leaks
  - Linters will show unused components so they can be removed
  - Source order independence eliminates the need to import files in a certain order
  - Compose new styles from existing components
  - Passing properties to the component allows for more flexibility

- Backend Server
  - The assignment did not instruct to create a backend, but in order to simimulate a more accurate flow of data for this assignment, I spun up a simple node.js server to serve the JSON files

## To Run Locally

- Clone the project and `git clone` in a local directory 
- `cd server` and `npm start`
- `cd client` and `npm start`
